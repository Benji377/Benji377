  - Voice simulator: Simulate the voice you actually hear in your head (which is different from the one the others hear)
  - Advanced file sorter: Automatically sort the files you put in a folder
  - Self-building robot: A robot capable of building a replica of himself if you give him the materials to do so
  - Space music: Send songs trough space
  - Alien detection system: Find aliens and communicate with them faster
  - Advanced to-do list: A creative and automatic to do list
  - Automatic spam unsubscriber: Unsubscribes your email from a list of possible advertisement websites
